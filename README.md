# Keychron C3 Pro RGB keyboard with hot-swappable switches
Firmware and .json VIA file for the Keychron C3 Pro RGB version

As of 4-30-24, the Keychron C3 Pro RGB edition is too new; Keychron has not yet released firmware or a .json file for VIA for this board. So I deicded to create one!

This file is a combination of the updated PID for the board (`0x0433`), the keymap for the otherwise-identical C3 Pro red LED version, and the lighting map from the C2 pro, which through experimentation was found to match the lighting on the C3 Pro RGB (thanks to Migiii from the VIA Discord for suggesting the possibility!).

# To use

* Download the .json file in this respository
* Head to https://usevia.app/
* Click the Settings gear icon
* Select Show Design Tab
* Click the newly-visible Design tab
* Click Load, next to Load Draft Definition
* Select the .json file you downloaded
* Your browser will ask you to select the keyboard to pair with it, do so
* Click the Configure tab icon
* Customize your board!

# Firmware

I've also added a copy of the C3 Pro RGB firmware, marked as v1.0.1 and dated March 8th 2024.  This was recieved through the Keychron Discord, from one of the Keychron devs [directly](https://discord.com/channels/673730324047462449/673744077912801300/1235063725598445618).  As of right now, this is pretty much the only copy available on the web, as the board is not yet on Keychron's site at all!
