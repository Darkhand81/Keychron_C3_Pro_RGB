# Keychron C3 Pro RGB keyboard with hot-swappable switches
A .json VIA file for the Keychron C3 Pro RGB version

As of 4-30-24, the Keychron C3 Pro RGB edition is too new; Keychron has not yet released a .json file for VIA for this board. So I deicded to create one!

This file is a combination of the updated PID for the board (`0x0433`), the keymap for the otherwise-identical C3 Pro red LED version, and the lighting map from the C2 pro, which through experimentation was found to match the lighting on the C3 Pro RGB (thanks to Migiii from the VIA Discord for suggesting the possibility!).
